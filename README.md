# pi-setup
Collection of basic pi setup - docker, portainer, etc.
Except for docker, all of the containers are cross-platform - x86 and ARM friendly!

Just run the pi-setup.sh script:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/C-Fu/pi-setup.git
cd pi-setup
sudo chmod +x pi-setup.sh
sudo ./pi-setup.sh
```
